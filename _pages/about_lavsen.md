I am PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Duke University, USA. My recent focus has been in the development of anthropomorphic phantoms using deep learning. These phantoms are integral for simulation studies and play a pivotal role in advancing Virtual Imaging Trials. This work is at the forefront of revolutionizing how we evaluate imaging techniques without relying on human subjects.

I have extensive experience in various areas of computer vision and machine learning, including uncertainty modeling, object detection, image segmentation, and image classification. My contributions in these domains have been documented in multiple research publications, which are available in my portfolio.

Prior to my current work, I had conducted research in labs across different countries, including UK, Spain, India, Nepal, and the United States. These diverse research experiences have enriched my understanding of global perspectives in the field.
